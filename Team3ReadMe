Team 3's goal was to take a text file containing pseudo Tex language decribing the contents of the source PDF and convert the text into a format that could then be read by the Text-To-Speech open source software we used. 

The DocumentClasses.py file contains the various classes used to separate the elements of the file, namely the paragraphs, figures, and equations. It calls the getEnglish() function from TexToEnglish script to convert the equations into english words. The document now consists of a number of text, figure, and equation blocks which are then sent to the t2s.py script which creates a .mp3 file. Based on the user's input the mp3 file is made using various options such as adding pauses whenever a figure is referenced based.
