Investigation of Thermal Waves in a Copper Rod to Measure the Thermal Diffusivity of Copper\paragraph{}Gillian Godden Lab Partner: Emily Mellors University of British Columbia PHYS 232: Modern Physics Laboratory\paragraph{}June 27, 2020\paragraph{}Abstract\paragraph{}The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the behaviour of thermal waves within a copper rod due to a square wave heat source oscillation, and to determine and compare our measured thermal diffusivity of copper with a previously measured thermal diffusivity of $\alpha = 1.108 \times 10^-4 m^{2}s^{-1}$ (Casalegno et al., 2010, p. 85). We did this by using thermistors to take measurements of the temperature oscillations at multiple points along the rod, taking a Fourier transform of the oscillations to determine the frequency content of the thermal waves, and using the amplitudes of the fundamental frequency at different points along the rod to plot the natural logarithm of the fundamental frequency as a function of distance from the heat source. We found that while the shape, frequencies present, and amplitudes of the thermal waves differed from theory, we extracted a thermal diffusivity of $\alpha = \left(1.1 \pm 0.1\right) \times 10^{-4} m^{2}s^{-1}$ that agreed within error with the previously measured value.\paragraph{}Introduction\paragraph{}The objective of this experiment was to investigate the thermal waves created from an oscillating heat source at one end of the rod, determine the frequency content of these oscillations at different points along the rod, and use this frequency content to measure the thermal diffusivity of copper and compare it to a previously measured value of $\alpha = 1.108 \times 10^{-4} m^{2}s^{-1}$ to determine its accuracy (Casalegno et al., 2010, p. 85).\paragraph{}Assume that the method of heat transfer is conduction, the thermal conductivity $\kappa$, the specific heat capacity c, and the density $\rho$ are constant with distance along the rod, and that there are no other sources of heat beyond an oscillating heat source at the position x = 0. In this case, one model governing the flow of heat through the rod is given by the heat equation, $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 x} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t},$ where $\alpha = \frac{\kappa}{c\rho}$ and where $T = T(x,t)$ is the temperature oscillation as a function of position x away from the heat source and time  (Nagle, Saf, & Snider, 2012, p. 568).\paragraph{}If we also assume that this oscillating heat source results in a square wave temperature oscillation at x = 0, then this temperature oscillation is given by the Fourier series $ \tilde{T}(0,t) = \sum_{n \	odd}^{\infty}  \frac{4 T_0}{n \pi} \sin{\left( \frac{2n\pi t}{\tau}\right)},
$ where $\tilde{T}(x,t)$ is the temperature oscillation, $T_0$ is the amplitude, and$\tau$ is the period of the oscillation (Bobowski, 2013, p. 3).\paragraph{}Using equations | and 2, it can then be shown that the thermal waves are described by $\tilde{T}(x,t) = \sum_{n \ odd}^{\infty} \frac{4 T_0}{n \pi} \exp{\left( -\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{n}}{2\alpha}}x \right)} \sin{\left( \omega_{n} t - \sqrt{\frac{\omega_{n}}{2\alpha}}x \right)},$ \paragraph{}where $\omega_n = \frac{2n\pi}{\tau}$ is the angular frequency (Bobowski, 2013, p. 4). Note that from equation 3, we would expect the waves to become more sinusoidal with increasing . We would also expect, at constant x, the amplitudes within the Fourier series as a function of $\omega_n$, to decay exponentially.\paragraph{}From equation 3, we see that the amplitude of the $n^{th}$ harmonic $A_n$, at x is given by $A_n = \frac{4 T_0}{n \pi} \exp{\left( -\sqrt{\frac{\omega_n}{2\alpha}}x \right)},$
