 EXAMPLE 6 Insert math here. Gonna probably include something about and image. Gonna probably include something about and image. Insert math here. Insert math here. A point or a particle moving arbitrarily in space may always be considered, at a
given instant, to be moving in a plane, circular path about a certain axis; that is,
the path a particle describes during an infinitesimal time interval 6¢ may be rep-
resented as an infinitesimal arc of a circle. The line passing through the center
of the circle and perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of motion is
called the instantaneous axis of rotation. As the particle moves in the circular
path, the rate of change of the angular position is called the angular velocity:
