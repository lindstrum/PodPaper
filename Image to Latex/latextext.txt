The rod was held up in the air by two foam supports to prevent damage to the laboratory table. Both the foam and the air had a low thermal conductivity and allowed us to approximate the rod to be insulated. A heater was connected to both a variable 60 Hz Varic power supply and the TTL output of a Pasco PI-9587c digital function generator. The Varic power supply, which was set to a voltage of 90V, powered the heater. The function generator, which was set to a frequency of 0.005 Hz, turned the heater on and off causing a square wave temperature output with a frequency of 0.005 Hz. Note this means that we expected the thermal waves to have a fundamental frequency of fo = 0.005 Hz at all points within the rod. Also, note that we did not change the waveform setting on the function generator as the TTL output automatically outputted a square wave. The heater was inserted into one end of the copper rod and ultimately the square wave temperature output caused by the heater caused the desired square wave temperature oscillation as expressed in equation 2.\paragraph{}There were six holes drilled into the copper rod at distances 9.00+0.05 cm, 14.00+0.05 cm, 18.90+0.05 cm, 24.00 + 0.05 cm, 33.70 £0.05 cm, and 44.00 + 0.05 cm away from the heater. Each hole was measured using a 30 cm ruler with the smallest increment of measurement being 0.1 cm and the error taken to be half the smallest increment of measurement. On the first day of measurements, we inserted 3 thermistors, resistors whose resistance decreases with increasing temperature, into the 9.00 + 0.05 cm, 14.00 + 0.05 cm, and 18.90 + 0.05 cm holes (Turner, 1976, p. 6-29). These thermistors were each connected to an Agilent 34401A digital multimeter (DMM) and set to measure resistance. As thermistor resistance depended on temperature, when thermistor resistance measurements were later made, these measurements were used to determine the temperature of the rod at the location of the holes at the specific times the measurements were made, and thus recorded the temperature oscillations within the copper rod. \end{figure}\paragraph{} \paragraph{}Finally, we connected the DMMs to a computer and opened a computer program called Labview. Labview was set up to record every two seconds the resistance measurements made by the DMMs as well as the time those measurements were made. With Labview set up, we turned on the Variac power supply, the function generator, and all three DMMs. We then started data collection within Labview and let data collection go on for approximately two hours and thirty minutes. On the second day of measurements, we did all this again but this time inserted thermistors into the 24.00 + 0.05 cm, 33.70 + 0.05 cm, and 44.00 + 0.05 cm holes. Labview also collected data that day for approximately two hours and 30 minutes. In the end, we ended up with six resistance data sets, one for each hole location along the rod, and two time data sets.\paragraph{} \paragraph{}Analysis, Results, and Discussion\paragraph{}The initial resistance data sets recorded by Labview were exported into Maple where all the analysis was done. Plots of the thermistor resistance as a function of time for each hole are shown in figure 2.
